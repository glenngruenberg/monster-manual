# The Monster Manual

My take at an interconnected Monster Manual for the classic GameBoy game Dragon Quest Monsters

This Manual will gradually and organically be updated while playing the actual game. It aims to contain an index of all monsters known to me, ordered by type, as well as reverse indizes for abilities, locations and possibly more.

WARNING - As I am Swiss and enjoy a fair bit of nostalgia when I play this game, I *WILL* maintain this manual in German, as the version I play is in German as well.
